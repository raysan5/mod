# MASTERS of DATA

Here it is the curse for MASTERS of DATA. A course oriented to understand and control your game data.

This course could be specially useful for Technical Designers and Technical Artists that want to deepen in data theory.

In this course you will learn to:

 - Understand your data: How data is organized, what is contained in the multiple data files of your game.
 - Process your data: Read multiple data files, extract the data you need and edit that data programatically.
 - Save and Protect your data: Design a custom file format, export your data to format, compress and codify your data.
 - Automatization processes: Create custom tools to read/write big bulks of data, define a command-line interface.
 - Optimization: How to get the most of your data for every situation and for every platform.
