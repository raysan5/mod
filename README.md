# MASTERS of DATA

Here it is the curse for MASTERS of DATA. A course oriented to understand and control your game data.

In this course you will learn to:

 - Understand your data: How data is organized, what is contained in the multiple data files of your game.
 - Process your data: Read multiple data files, extract the data you need and edit that data programatically.
 - Save and Protect your data: Design a custom file format, export your data to format, compress and codify your data.
 - Automatization processes: Create custom tools to read/write big bulks of data, define a command-line interface.
 - Optimization: How to get the most of your data for every situation and for every platform.
