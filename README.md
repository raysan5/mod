# MASTERS of DATA

_**WARNING: This outline is just a draft for a course proposal, it's under development and very prone to changes.**_

Here it is the course for MASTERS of DATA. A course oriented to **Technical Designers**, **Technical Artists** and any **game developer** that wants to understand and control game data to the last bit.

In this course you will learn to:

 - **Understand your data:** How data is organized, what is contained in every data file of your game.
 - **Process your data:** Read multiple data files, extract the data you need and edit that data programatically.
 - **Visualize your data:** Create custom tools to display images, audio, text, models and any kind of data.
 - **Save and Protect your data:** Design a custom file format, export your data to format, compress and codify your data.
 - **Automatize processes:** Create custom tools to read/write big bulks of data, define a command-line interface.
 - **Optimization techniques:** How to get the most of your data for every situation and for every platform.
