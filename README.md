# MASTERS of DATA

Welcome to MASTERS of DATA. A course oriented to **Technical Designers**, **Technical Artists** and any **game developer** that wants to understand and control game data to the last bit.

In this course you will learn to:

 - **Understand your data:** How game data is organized, what is contained in every data file of your game.
 - **Process your data:** Read multiple data files, extract the data you need and edit that data programatically.
 - **Optimize your data:** Reduce size, improve quality, get the best results for every situation and for platform.
 - **Visualize your data:** Create custom tools to display your data: images, audio, text, models... any kind of data.
 - **Protect your data:** Design a custom file format and export your data to it, compress and codify your data.
 - **Automatize processes:** Create custom tools to read/write big bulks of data in batch, define a command-line interface.
